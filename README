Untitled economic game
------------------------

Buy low, sell high. Players must buy and sell trade goods by negotiating with different factions and fighting off bandits and highwaymen. 
- Upgrade your donkey to a horse, then a wagon, then a fleet of wagons protected by caravan guards.
- Exploit opportunities such as grain shortages and drought, war's hunger for iron or the latest 		social / fashon trends.
- Smuggle illicit goods to make huge profits but be careful. Getting caught can ruin your reputation as a ligitimate trader and get you barred from towns and cities.
